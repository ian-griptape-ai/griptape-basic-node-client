3. Create a `.env` based on the `example.env` file in the root directory and add your Griptape API key and endpoint URLs:
   ```
   GRIPTAPE_API_URL=https://cloud.griptape.ai/api
   GRIPTAPE_API_KEY=your_Griptape_Cloud_api_key
   STRUCTURE_ID=the Structure ID of the Structure that you wish to invoke
   ```

## Usage
